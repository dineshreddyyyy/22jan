    <div>At the Institute, a team composed of faculty from the departments of
business administration, computer engineering, education, and electrical and
electronics engineering launched the METU-Online project in May 1998.
The software platform for preparing and delivering online courses has been
developed at the Institute and is being maintained by the Institute’s Distance
Education Laboratory. The first implementation took place in fall 1998 and
within one year a total of 15 courses were offered to around 2,000 on-campus
and off-campus students. All online courses come from the undergraduate and
graduate curricula of various departments within the university, ranging from
history to astronomy. The courses are developed and delivered by resident
faculty. The mode of delivery varies among courses, from fully online course
conduct, to the use of online material in addition to full class contact hours.<br><br>
METU-Online also enables the efficient use of scarce faculty resources
to teach large audiences. At METU, all first-year students (approximately
3,000 freshmen) are required to take an introductory computer literacy course.
To meet this requirement, the Introduction to Information Technologies and
Applications course (IS 100) has been designed by the Informatics Institute
and is being delivered through METU-Online to 1,500 students each semester.<br><br>
In February 1999, the Institute launched its online Informatics Certificate Program to train instructors from other Turkish universities to
design and deliver introductory computer literacy courses such as IS 100
in their own universities. Instructors from various universities followed
the program asynchronously from their respective institutions. The
university’s first online graduate program, leading to the degree of Master
of Science in Informatics is the latest addition to its expanding portfolio
of Internet-based learning applications.<br><br>
The METU experience has recently prompted the Higher Education
Council of Turkey, the governing body of all public and private universities
in the country, to establish a national initiative for the development and
exchange of Internet-based courses and programs between Turkish universities. The Higher Education Council provides funding, coordinates and
regulates all aspects of interuniversity collaboration for e-learning.<br>
The remainder of the chapter presents the evolution of an Internet-based
education system, from its inception to its implementation, focusing on the
issues that are of critical importance at each phase. It reflects the decision
hierarchy and sequence of activities recommended for successfully integrating online courses, certificate and degree programs in universities. The
recommendations are drawn from the lessons learned at METU during the
development of its institutional e-learning system.

    <h1>THE INITIATION AND PLANNING OF INTERNET-<br>BASED LEARNING</h1>
    <h3>Introducing the E-Learning Paradigm</h3>
    <div>Integrating a new educational paradigm into an existing system is
often more complicated than establishing a totally new system. Entrenched organizational culture, academic norms, administrative bureauracies, and technological constraints impose a greater challenge. Current
experience shows that a fundamental rethinking of the missions, goals and
operations is necessary in traditional institutions (Calvert, 2001; Harris &
DiPaolo, 1999). Radical change is seldom possible; incremental change is
often the preferred approach.<br>
A prerequisite for success is the university’s strong commitment to this
paradigm (Bourne, 1998; King, McCausland & Nunan, 2001). Its strategies must
reflect how the institution wants to position itself in the spectrum of e-learning
applications. This will depend on the goals that are targeted. These might include:<br>
• Enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education;<br>
• Increasing outreach to serve different learner populations;<br>
• Being more responsive to learner and faculty needs; and<br>
• Improving efficiency in the utilization of scarce educational resources.
Accordingly, different institutions are likely to leverage the Internet in
different ways. Some will use new technologies to reduce the cost of
delivering courses and increase outreach to off-campus students; others to
enhance the learning experience of on-campus students; others still, to
facilitate large class management on campus. Needless to say, a combination
of several objectives is the norm rather than the exception.<br>
Based on the objectives set by the institution, the first step in initiating an
Internet-based learning environment is to establish the scope and feasibility
of such an undertaking. This in turn will be instrumental in determining the
organizational arrangement for the development and implementation of elearning. In addition, existing institutional policies have to be reviewed, and
if necessary, revised at this stage.</div><br><br>
    
    <h3>Scope and Feasibility</h3>
    
   <div>In order to determine the scope of an institution’s e-learning initiative a
number of questions have to be answered: Should online instruction be
available to off-campus students only? Should the emphasis be on individual
courses or degree and certificate programs? Should priority be given to
existing courses/programs or new ones tailored for specific markets? Should
all online offerings be developed and delivered by regular faculty?
</div> 
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>
    <div>Alternative directions are possible. Online education can be targeted to
resident students, either as a supplement to face-to-face instruction or as a
substitute. It could be offered to off-campus students only, or serve both
student constituencies. At METU, the decision was to make no differentiation
between resident and off-campus students, since the university is seeking to
enrich the learning experience on-campus, as well as provide opportunities
for learners who are place bound. In terms of courses to be offered online,
METU took an evolutionary approach, starting with individual courses
already listed in the university’s curricula, leading to the development of new
online certificate and degree programs. With scalability in mind, the rationale
for this approach was that encouraging the conversion of existing individual
courses to the online mode would help to spread awareness to all academic
units, and obtain the commitment of faculty and students. At METU, online
course development and delivery is carried out by regular faculty in order to
capitalize on the existing academic strength and reputation of the university.<br>
The determination of the viability of online instruction for a particular
institution requires the assessment of operational, technical and economic
feasibility. At METU, the effects of organizational culture and the degree of
resistance to change among administrators, faculty and students, as well as the
constraints imposed by administrative procedures have been investigated to
derive operational feasibility. The university’s technical infrastructure and
related skills portfolio were examined to establish technical feasibility.
Possible sources of funding have been identified, and a preliminary three-year
budget was derived to test economic feasibility.</div><br>
    <br>
    <h3>Organization of the E-Learning Initiative</h3>
    
    
   <div>The next decision relates to the organization of the e-learning initiative.
One possibility is to adopt a decentralized approach and delegate the development of online instruction to those academic units having or planning
online offerings. Another option is to take a centralized institutional approach
and assign the responsibility for the entire initiative to a single unit. The choice
is of primary importance for long-term sustainability. At METU, the outcome
of the feasibility study resulted in the derivation of a project plan and the
formation of an interdisciplinary project team under a single independent unit,
namely the Informatics Institute. The main factors leading to this final choice
can be cited as follows:<br>
• The need for coordination to uphold an institutional network;<br>
• The concern for the efficient use of university resources, avoiding<br>
duplication;<br>
• The fair allocation of resources to all units involved;

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>• The flexibility to extend the scope of services to different target groups;<br>
• The necessity to maintain the ownership, management and balance of
online offerings.<br>
At this point, the institution’s existing policies and procedures have
to be reviewed to determine their suitability for incorporating a different
mode of learning.</div>
    
    
    <h3>Institutional Policies</h3>
    <div>The integration of e-learning often requires the revision of institutional policies and development of new ones. Issues that are important in
this respect include: the quality of online courses and programs, the
administrative procedures for online learning, the ownership of intellectual property, faculty compensation, and the management of technology
and support services for e-learning.</div>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="italiic">Quality of Online Instruction</p>
    <div>A key concern for all institutions engaged in Internet-based education is
the maintenance of academic standards for online courses and programs.
Credit equivalencies with their traditional counterparts, and procedures for
assessing their quality have to be established. Many stakeholders still question the effectiveness of online learning when compared to face-to-face
instruction. Accreditation is seen as a way to “legitimize” the quality of online
offerings. Therefore, some form of accreditation, whether national, regional
or institutional, has to be instituted. On the other hand, existing accreditation
standards mostly pertain to traditional education, therefore, their applicability
to e-learning is a contentious issue. There is a need to develop specific
standards for online education and improve coordination between different
accreditation agencies (Stallings, 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Webbased Education Commission, 2000). Recently, the Institute for Higher
Education Policy identified 24 benchmarks to ascertain quality in Internetbased distance education (The Institute for Higher Education Policy, 2000).
The benchmarks are grouped under seven headings: institutional support,
course development, teaching/learning, course structure, student support,
faculty support, and evaluation and assessment. Together they provide a
useful template for all stakeholders to determine what constitutes quality in
online distance education.<br>
Unlike the U.S., there are no national or regional accreditation agencies
in Turkey. METU has therefore, developed its own internal accreditation
procedure to assure the quality of online courses and programs. The process
of accreditation at METU is described later in the chapter.

    <p class="italic">Administrative Issues</p>
    
    <div>On the administrative side, conformance of this new mode of delivery to
the university’s existing statutes, rules and procedures has to be determined.
Matters that have been considered at METU include alignment with the
criteria set out by the academic rules and regulations of the university.
Accordingly, the requirements for admission to and graduation from online
programs are as strict as the ones for traditional programs. New administrative
procedures have also been introduced to integrate the application and registration of online students into the existing system, enabling remote application, registration and payment of tuition fees. The procedure for the approval
of new courses and programs by the university’s academic boards has been
revised to include online courses and programs.<br>
Another issue to be addressed by the institution is the provision of
Internet services to students. This is especially a concern in countries
where connection to Internet service providers is costly and bandwidth
limitations restrict the speed of communication. For its certificate and
degree programs, METU gives each participant an unlimited Internet
account through TR-NET, an Internet service provider directly connected
to the university’s ATM network. This facilitates access and allows faster
communication among users.</div><br><br>

    <p class="italic">Copyright</p>
    
    
    <div>The digital age challenges the hitherto established principles of intellectual property and copyright. The Internet makes possible the almost limitless
distribution and usage of information. Current legislation is inadequate to
define the impact of copyright laws on online education. Although the Digital
Millennium Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1998, addresses certain
aspects related to electronic piracy, the concept of “fair use” of copyrighted
material in a digital environment needs further clarification. This affects
universities engaged in online education in two ways. First, the ownership of
individual course content has to be established. Second, intellectual property
has to be protected. Consequently, universities have to review their copyright
policy, not only for the material produced in the courses, but also for the
material used to produce the courses. So far, very few institutions have
established policies with respect to the ownership of online material developed by faculty (Council for Higher Education Accreditation, 2000). The
American Association of University Professors (AAUP) recommends
that, in principle, faculty members who have developed material for
distance education should own the copyright, except in the case of works
made-for-hire that are not part of their normal workload, or when the
